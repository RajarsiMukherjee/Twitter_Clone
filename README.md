Thanks for visiting [Twitter](https://twitter-clone-ba49b.web.app/)!

### Twitter is a microblogging platform where people can express their thoughts in short posts which people can read and share! We built a Twitter Clone using React JS in the frontend along with Firebase as a Backend provider. We used Firebase Firestore as a database and used Firebase Hosting to bring our clone to live on the internet. We can post along with Images. We will also be fetching real Twitter posts for a section in our Clone application. Our team consists of Five members from FT-WEB14, this is 4th construct week for us. As we construct/clone a web page, this is our project from the 5th unit at Masai School.
